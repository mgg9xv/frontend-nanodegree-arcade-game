# Instructions

### Running the game

In order to run the game one simply needs to navigate to the [github page](http://mgg9xv.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

### Playing the game

* Use the arrow keys to move the player forward, backwards, left, and right.
* The goal of the game is to get your player to other side of the road as many times as you can without dying.
* If you touch the creepy crawlies, you will lose a life and will be brought back to the beginning side.
* Lose all 10 lives and your game is over.
* Don't worry, though. Just hit OK on the javascript alert and you can continue playing all day.
