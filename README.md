## How to play

* Use the arrow keys  to move the player forward, backwards, left, and right.
* The goal of the game is to get your player to other side of the road as many times as you can without dying.
* If you touch the creepy crawlies, you will lose a life and will be brought back to the beginning side.
* Lose all 5 lives and your game is over.
* Don't worry, though. Just hit `OK` when the game ends and you can continue playing all day.
