===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# Instructions

### Running the game

In order to run the game one simply needs to navigate to the [github page](http://mgg9xv.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

### Playing the game

* Use the arrow keys to move the player forward, backwards, left, and right.
* The goal of the game is to get your player to other side of the road as many times as you can without dying.
* If you touch the creepy crawlies, you will lose a life and will be brought back to the beginning side.
* Lose all 10 lives and your game is over.
* Don't worry, though. Just hit OK on the javascript alert and you can continue playing all day.
